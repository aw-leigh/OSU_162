/*

When the program starts, you need to manually instantiate at least 
1 student, 
1 instructor, and 
2 buildings inside the University object. 

It can be done by either hard coding that information, 
or have the user input all the information at the start of the program.

The menu must have at least the following options:

1. Prints information about all the buildings
2. Prints information of everybody at the university
3. Choose a person to do work
4. Exit the program

If option 3 is selected, the program should print another menu that 
prints all the peopleâ€™s name and let the user input the choice of the person the user would like to do work.
